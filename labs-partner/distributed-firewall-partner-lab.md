# Introduction

In this lab we are going to start with looking at the basic tasks which you will perform in the VMware Cloud on AWS user interface when you are administering the platform.

We will start by allowing inbound internet access to your vCenter managing your SDDC. We have already pre-created the VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC environment for you, in order to save time.
