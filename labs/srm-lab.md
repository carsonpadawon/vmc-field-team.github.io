# Introduction

In this lab you will pair up with another student group in order to simulate the setup and configuration tasks for VMware Site Recovery Manager

## Activate Site Recovery Add On

Important Instructions for Site Recovery Exercises

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE EXERCISES MUST BE PERFORMED FROM THE ASSIGNED HORIZON DESKTOP YOUR INSTRUCTORS ASSIGNED. IF YOU TRY TO PERFORM SOME OF THE EXERCISES OUTSIDE OF THE HORIZON SESSION YOU WILL EXPERIENCE SOME FAILURES.

### Activate Site Recovery

1. In your VMware Cloud on AWS Organisation, click on the **View Details** for your SDDC deployment
2. Click on the **Add ons** tab
3. Under the Site Recovery Add On, Click the **Activate** button
4. In the pop up window Click **Activate** again

Wait until the Site Recovery Add On has been activated. This process should take ~10 minutes to complete.

## What is VMware Site Recovery

VMware Site Recovery brings VMware enterprise-class Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) Disaster Recovery as a Service to the AWS Cloud. It enables customers to protect and recover applications without the requirement for a dedicated secondary site. It is delivered, sold, supported, maintained and managed by VMware as an on-demand service. IT teams manage their cloud-based resources with familiar VMware tools without the difficulties of learning new skills or utilizing new tools and processes.

VMware Site Recovery is an add-on feature to VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS integrates VMware's flagship compute, storage, and network virtualization products: VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, and VMware NSX along with VMware vCenter Server management. It optimizes them to run on elastic, bare-metal AWS infrastructure. With the same architecture and operational experience on-premises and in the cloud, IT teams can now get instant business value via the AWS and VMware hybrid cloud experience.

The VMware Cloud on AWS solution enables customers to have the flexibility to treat their private cloud and public cloud as equal partners and to easily transfer workloads between them, for example, to move applications from DevTest to production or burst capacity. Users can leverage the global AWS footprint while getting the benefits of elastically scalable SDDC clusters, a single bill from VMware for its tightly integrated software plus AWS infrastructure, and on-demand or subscription services like VMware Site Recovery Service. VMware Site Recovery extends VMware Cloud on AWS to provide a managed disaster recovery, disaster avoidance and non-disruptive testing capabilities to VMware customers without the need for a secondary site, or complex configuration.

VMware Site Recovery works in conjunction with VMware Site Recovery Manager and VMware vSphere Replication to automate the process of recovering, testing, re-protecting, and failing-back virtual machine workloads. VMware Site Recovery utilizes VMware Site Recovery Manager servers to coordinate the operations of the VMware SDDC. This is so that, as virtual machines at the protected site are shut down, copies of these virtual machines at the recovery site startup. By using the data replicated from the protected site these virtual machines assume responsibility for providing the same services.

![SRM Scenarios](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/Screenshot+at+Jul+20+18-03-34.png)

VMware Site Recovery can be used between a customers datacenter and an SDDC deployed on VMware Cloud on AWS or it can be used between two SDDCs deployed to different AWS availability zones or regions. The second option allows VMware Site Recovery to provide a fully VMware managed and maintained Disaster Recovery solution. Migration of protected inventory and services from one site to the other is controlled by a recovery plan that specifies the order in which virtual machines are shut down and started up, the resource pools to which they are allocated, and the networks they can access.

VMware Site Recovery enables the testing of recovery plans, using a temporary copy of the replicated data, and isolated networks in a way that does not disrupt ongoing operations at either site. Multiple recovery plans can be configured to migrate individual applications or entire sites providing finer control over what virtual machines are failed over and failed back. This also enables flexible testing schedules. VMware Site Recovery extends the feature set of the virtual infrastructure platform to provide for rapid business continuity through partial or complete site failures.

## Create a Cross SDDC VPN

We will be setting up an IPSEC VPN connection between your VPC and the VPC of the person you were paired with.

1. Go back to the **VMware Cloud on AWS** tab.
2. In the main SDDC window, click on **View Details**
3. Click on the **Network** menu

In the Management Gateway section, make a note of the Public IP and the Infrastructure Subnet CIDR

![Management Gteway IP](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/Screenshot+at+Jul+20+18-03-34.png)

In the Management Gateway settings below

1. Click the drop down arrow to open the **IPsec VPNs** section
2. Click on **ADD VPN**

Fill in the following information

1. Name: Student # MGMT GW (where # is your student number)
2. The **Public IP address** of the persons Gateway you were paired with
3. The **Infrastructure IP CIDR** of the person you were paired with
4. Pre-shared key is **VMware1!**
5. Click on **Save**

When both you and the person you were paired with have completed these steps you should see the status of the VPN turn to **Connected**

There will be a need to setup a second VPN to our Host infrastructure for this setup to work. This is not normally needed when setting up your on-premises environment but it's needed for the special setup in this workshop.

1. Make sure the IPSecVPNs drop down is opened, if not click it under **Management Gateway**
2. Click on **Add VPN**

    Fill in the following information
3. Name this VPN **Student# to Host** (where # is your student number)
4. Enter **54.70.191.234** for the Remote Gateway Public IP
5. Enter **192.168.30.0/24** under Remote Networks
6. Pre-shared key is **VMware1!**
7. Click on **Save**.

## Prepare and Pair Site Recovery

### Firewall Rules for Site Recovery

If you still have your OAuth Token from the Powershell module, you are free to use it, otherwise, follow the following instructions to obtain a new one.

1. Click on the drop down next to your **Name/Org ID** in the top right hand corner
2. Click **My Account**
3. Click on **API Tokens**

If you already have a token from the previous API lab, please reuse this, if not you can create a new one using the following steps

1. Click on **Create a new token**
2. Click on **Continue**
3. Click on **Copy to Clipboard**

Now let's attach to the VMC server

From your Horizon workstation, replacing the refreshtoken placeholder below with your token.

``` powershell
connect-vmc -refreshtoken "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

####Â Import Firewall Rules for Site Recovery via PowerCLI

Open a Powershell window and enter the following commands:

``` powershell
Set-Location \\vmcwindc01\documents
.\import-dr-fw-rules.ps1 -refreshToken "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" -orgName "VMC-WS#" -sddcName "Student Workshop #"
```

Where xxxx is the OAuth Token you generated in a previous step and # is your Student number.

Ensure the appropriate firewall rules were created by following the below instructions.

1. Click on the **Network** tab in your Student SDDC
2. Expand **Firewall Rules** under the **Management Gateway**

Confirm the following Firewall Rules have been created:

SRM 9086
VR Replication
VR 8043
VR 443
VR Out
SRM Out

Please note that the rules may have been created in a different order than shown above.
