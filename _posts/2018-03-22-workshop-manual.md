## Configuring SDDC Firewall Rules

### Management Gateway Firewall Rules

By default, the firewall for the management gateway is set to deny all inbound and outbound traffic. In this exercise, you will add a firewall rule to allow vCenter traffic. In order to access vCenter Server in your SDDC, you must set a firewall rule to allow traffic to the vCenter Server.

1. Under **Management Gateway** click the arrow to expand **Firewall Rules**
2. Click **Add Rule**
3. Enter a name for your rule under **Rule Name**
4. Type **Any** for Source
5. Make sure **vCenter** is selected as Destination
6. Select **HTTPS (TCP 443)** from the drop down box for Service
7. Click the **SAVE** button, your rule should look like the below image

### Compute Gateway Firewall Rules

By default, the Compute NSX Edge Services Gateway is also set to deny all inbound and outbound traffic. You need to add additional firewall rules to allow traffic as needed.

####Â Create Firewall Rule under Compute Gateway for Inbound Native AWS Services access.

1. Under **Network** tab, navigate to **Compute Gateway**
2. Expand **Firewall Rules**
3. Click **ADD RULE**

## AWS Inbound Firewall Rule

### Create AWS Inbound Firewall Rule

1. **Name** - AWS Inbound
2. **Action** - Allow
3. **Source** - All connected Amazon VPC
4. **Destination** - 192.168.#.0/24 (Where # is your student number)
5. **Service** - ANY
6. Click **SAVE** button.

### AWS Outbound Firewall Rule

Follow the same process as in the previous step and create AWS Outbound Firewall Rule following these instructions:

1. **Name** - AWS Outbound
2. **Action** - Allow
3. **Source** - 192.168.#.0/24 (Where # is your student number)
4. **Destination** - All connected Amazon VPC
5. **Service** - ANY
6. Click **SAVE** button.

#### Log into VMware Cloud on AWS vCenter

Connection Info Tab

Login to your Student # SDDC and click on the **Connection Info** tab. This displays different connection information for your VMware Cloud on AWS environment like:

- URL to vSphere Client HTML5 client for your vCenter server
- URL to vCenter Server API Explorer
- Local Username for access to vCenter Server on VMware Cloud on AWS **cloudadmin@vmc.local**
- Ability to copy Username to your computer's clipboard
- Password to utilize for the cloudadmin user to access vCenter
- Ability to view cloudadmin's password
- Ability to copy cloudadmin's password to your computer's clipboard
- PowerCLI Connect string to be used if you desire to use PowerCLI to connect to your VMware Cloud on AWS vCenter Server
- Ability to copy PowerCLI string to your computer's clipboard

Click on the vSphere Client's HTML5 URL, and login with **cloudadmin@vmc.local** User Name and copy the password to your computer's clipboard and paste it in the Password Field.

You are now logged in to your VMware Cloud on AWS vCenter Server as **cloudadmin@vmc.local** user.

### Create Content Library

Content libraries are container objects for VM templates, vApp templates, and other types of files like ISO images. You can create a content library in the vSphere Web Client, and populate it with templates, which you can use to deploy virtual machines or vApps in your VMware Cloud on AWS environment or if you already have a Content Library in your on-premises data center, you can use the Content Library to import content into your SDDC. You can create two types of libraries: local or subscribed libraries.

Local Libraries You use a local library to store items in a single vCenter Server instance. You can publish the local library so that users from other vCenter Server systems can subscribe to it. When you publish a content library externally, you can configure a password for authentication. VM templates and vApp templates are stored as an OVF file format in the content library. You can also upload other file types, such as ISO images, text files, and so on, in a content library.

### Subscribed Libraries

You subscribe to a published library by creating a subscribed library. You can create the subscribed library in the same vCenter Server instance where the published library is, or in a different vCenter Server system. In the Create Library wizard you have the option to download all the contents of the published library immediately after the subscribed library is created, or to download only metadata for the items from the published library and later to download the full content of only the items you intend to use. To ensure the contents of a subscribed library are up-to-date, the subscribed library automatically synchronizes to the source published library on regular intervals. You can also manually synchronize subscribed libraries. You can use the option to download content from the source published library immediately or only when needed to manage your storage space.

Synchronization of a subscribed library that is set with the option to download all the contents of the published library immediately, synchronizes both the item metadata and the item contents. During the synchronisation the library items that are new for the subscribed library are fully downloaded to the storage location of the subscribed library. Synchronization of a subscribed library that is set with the option to download contents only when needed synchronizes only the metadata for the library items from the published library, and does not download the contents of the items. This saves storage space. If you need to use a library item you need to synchronize that item. After you are done using the item, you can delete the item contents to free space on the storage. For subscribed libraries that are set with the option to download contents only when needed, synchronizing the subscribed library downloads only the metadata of all the items in the source published library, while synchronizing a library item downloads the full content of that item to your storage. If you use a subscribed library, you can only utilize the content, but cannot contribute with content. Only the administrator of the published library can manage the templates and files.

1. Click on **Menu**
2. Click on **Content Libraries**

### Create Linux Customization Spec

When you clone a virtual machine or deploy a virtual machine from a template, you can customize the guest operating system of the virtual machine to change properties such as the computer name, network settings, and license settings. Customizing guest operating systems can help prevent conflicts that can result if virtual machines with identical settings are deployed, such as conflicts due to duplicate computer names. You can specify the customization settings by launching the Guest Customization wizard during the cloning or deployment process. Alternatively, you can create customization specifications, which are customization settings stored in the vCenter Server database. During the cloning or deployment process, you can select a customization specification to apply to the new virtual machine. Use the Customization Specification Manager to manage customization specifications you create with the Guest Customization wizard.

There may be a slight delay the first time but the command **install-module** will complete. Note: You will be asked to install the NuGet provider, take the default or press Y and press enter, you will then be asked to trust an untrusted repository, DO NOT take the default but type **Y** and press Enter.

We now need to set the execution policy to Remote Signed.

``` powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Note: You will be asked to change the execution policy, type **Y** and press Enter

You now will need to set the PowerCLI Configuration to Ignore Invalid Certificates.

IMPORTANT STEP:

``` powershell
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore
```

NOTE: Be sure the "i" in "Ignore" is capitalized

NOTE: You will be asked to Update PowerCLI Configuration, type Y and press Enter

We now need to install the VMware CLI commands

``` powershell
Install-Module -name VMware.VMC -scope AllUsers
```

Note: You will be asked to trust an untrusted repository, type Y and press Enter

Let's take a quick look at the VMware CLI commands.

``` powershell
Get-VMCCommand
```

We now need to get your Refresh Token from the VMC console. Switch back to or open the web browser and log into **vmc.vmware.com**

If you are not already logged in

1. open a new tab
2. click on the **VMware Cloud on AWS** bookmark shortcut
3. Fill in your email address
4. click on **Next**

optional

NOTE: Paste the refresh token you copied earlier in the exercise.

Now we can see what Orgs we have access to

``` powershell
Get-VMCorg
```

1. Note the Org Display_Name and ID

Now that we know the Org Display_Name we can find out information about the SDDC's inside our org.

```powershell
Get-VMCSDDC -Org VMC-WS#
```

NOTE:replace # with your workstation number

Another cool thing you can do is see the Default Credentials for your SDDC

```powershell
Get-VMCSDDCDefaultCredential -org VMC-WS#
```

NOTE:replace # with your workstation number

What is VMware Site Recovery?

VMware Site Recovery brings VMware enterprise-class Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) Disaster Recovery as a Service to the AWS Cloud. It enables customers to protect and recover applications without the requirement for a dedicated secondary site. It is delivered, sold, supported, maintained and managed by VMware as an on-demand service. IT teams manage their cloud-based resources with familiar VMware tools without the difficulties of learning new skills or utilizing new tools. VMware Site Recovery is an add-on feature to VMware Cloud on AWS, powered by VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware Cloud on AWS integrates VMware's flagship compute, storage, and network virtualization products: VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, and VMware NSX along with VMware vCenter Server management. It optimizes them to run on elastic, bare-metal AWS infrastructure. With the same architecture and operational experience on-premises and in the cloud, IT teams can now get instant business value via the AWS and VMware hybrid cloud experience. The VMware Cloud on AWS solution enables customers to have the flexibility to treat their private cloud and public cloud as equal partners and to easily transfer workloads between them, for example, to move applications from DevTest to production or burst capacity. Users can leverage the global AWS footprint while getting the benefits of elastically scalable SDDC clusters, a single bill from VMware for its tightly integrated software plus AWS infrastructure, and on-demand or subscription services like VMware Site Recovery Service. VMware Site Recovery extends VMware Cloud on AWS to provide a managed disaster recovery, disaster avoidance and non-disruptive testing capabilities to VMware customers without the need for a secondary site, or complex configuration.

VMware Site Recovery works in conjunction with VMware Site Recovery Manager 8.0 and VMware vSphere Replication 8.0 to automate the process of recovering, testing, re-protecting, and failing-back virtual machine workloads. VMware Site Recovery utilizes VMware Site Recovery Manager servers to coordinate the operations of the VMware SDDC. This is so that as virtual machines at the protected site are shut down, copies of these virtual machines at the recovery site startup. By using the data replicated from the protected site these virtual machines assume responsibility for providing the same services.

VMware Site Recovery can be used between a customers datacenter and an SDDC deployed on VMware Cloud on AWS or it can be used between two SDDCs deployed to different AWS availability zones or regions. The second option allows VMware Site Recovery to provide a fully VMware managed and maintained Disaster Recovery solution. Migration of protected inventory and services from one site to the other is controlled by a recovery plan that specifies the order in which virtual machines are shut down and started up, the resource pools to which they are allocated, and the networks they can access. VMware Site Recovery enables the testing of recovery plans, using a temporary copy of the replicated data, and isolated networks in a way that does not disrupt ongoing operations at either site. Multiple recovery plans can be configured to migrate individual applications or entire sites providing finer control over what virtual machines are failed over and failed back. This also enables flexible testing schedules. VMware Site Recovery extends the feature set of the virtual infrastructure platform to provide for rapid business continuity through partial or complete site failures.
